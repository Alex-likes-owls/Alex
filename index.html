            A brief summary of The Amazing World Of Gumball or TAWOG.
          </h3>
          <p class="bs">
            The Amazing World of Gumball, or TAWOG, was a cartoon aired on
            Cartoon Network from 2011 to 2019 about an anthropomorphic cat named
            Gumball and his adopted fish brother, Darwin. While most episodes
            revolve around the troublemakers, their dysfunctional family get
            their fair share of screen time. Their man-child father, Richard and
            their powerful mother, Nicole, and their cunning genius sister Anais
            often join in with the boys' buffoonery.

              Gumball Tristopher "Trisha" Watterson, born Zach Watterson is the
              main protagonist of the show. He is a mischievous blue cat who
              lives with his parents and has a girlfriend named Penny. Gumball
              was first portrayed as naive but well-intentioned. However, later
              in the show, he was portrayed as more serious, rational, and
              sardonic. Despite having moments of bad judgment, Gumball is a
              loyal, honest, good-natured person. He's protective of his loved
              ones but due to his large ego, he frequently overreacts.

              Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemus Watterson III is the
              deuteragonist of The Amazing World of Gumball. Like Gumball, he
              was much more naive in the early seasons of the show but slowly
              became more sarcastic, although not as much as Gumball. He was
              originally Gumball's pet goldfish, but one day, he grew legs and
              adaplted to living on land, so he was adopted by the Watterson
              family. He's known for being kind and has a girlfriend named
              carrie.

            The tritagonist and one of The Amazing World of Gumball's primary

            she's the most logical of her family. She attends Elmore Junior High
            with her elder brothers, Gumball and Darwin, and is in a higher
            grade than them, as is made clear in "The Others." She is known for
            her inability to make friends and is often shown with her plush toy,
            Daisy.

            Doctor Nicole Meg Watterson is the tetartagonist of The Amazing
            World of Gumball. Nicole is a blue cat like Gumball and is the mom
            of the Watterson family. She is the most and maybe the only
            responsible one in the family. She is skilled in martial arts and is
            known for her quick temper. Richard Watterson is the secondary
            tetartagonist of The Amazing World of Gumball. He serves the role of
            the father in the Watterson family. He's irresponsible and a slob
            but he's shown to care for his family very much. Nicole and Richard
            met each other in unconventional ways, but they both seem to love
            each other unconditionally.

              he's shown to be hiding in the background of all the clips. What's
              even more unnerving is that the clown never faces the characters,
              rather he stares at the audience. Although it was proven that the
              clips were edited for the episode, most fans claim that the clown
              is still in the background of lots of episodes.

              They team up with their teacher, Mr. Small to save her. Along the
              way, another missing person, Rob tries to catch their attention
              but he's unsuccessful. In the end, Molly is saved but while

              clings onto the back of the van. Unfortunately, he becomes

              Molly Collins is a recurring character in The Amazing World Of
              Gumball. Because she was boring, she was sent to the void and
              considered a mistake. Eventually, she was rescued but was still
              seen as boring. She is seen in the background of most episodes.

              The Amazing World of Gumball's primary antagonist and supporting
              character's Rob. He was initially depicted as a minor background
              student at Elmore Junior High. He was sent to the Void when the
              world realized how useless he was, but he managed to get away by
              clinging to Janice's back. Later, he develops into the show's main
              antagonist and Gumball's arch-enemy in later seasons.
